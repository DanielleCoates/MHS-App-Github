## Introduction

The **MHS-App** aims to develop an app designed to support those struggling with depression. The app allows users to document their mood throughout the day through a simple mood-tracking feature. With this data, the appâ€™s AI-powered bot generates a personalized mental wellness plan for the user. In addition to wellness plans, the app offers access to a library of mental health resources to further support users in their journey.

This project is part of the CMSC 355 course and demonstrates the software development process from requirements gathering to implementation.

## Features

- **Mood Tracking**: Allows users to log their daily mood and track changes over time.
- **Personalized Plans**: App's AI bot generates personalized mental wellness plans based on the user's mood data.
- **Resource Recommendations**: Provides a list of mental health resources based on user preferences and needs.

## Project Files

### Software Development Process

The **Software Development Process** contains a detailed diagram that visually portrays the app's development stages. This diagram includes the planning, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance phases, demonstrating the steps followed throughout the development cycle.

### Software Requirements Specification

The **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** file breaks down the key requirements for the app, which are divided into two sections:

- **Functional Requirements**: This section outlines the essential features that the app must support, such as user registration, mood tracking, and providing mental health resources.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: This section covers performance, usability, security, and scalability expectations for the app, ensuring that it not only works but also meets high standards of user experience and data protection.

Both documents are critical in understanding the structure and requirements of the app.
